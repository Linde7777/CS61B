I have tried my best to optimize readability, if you have any 
question about my code, please feel free to contact me.  

## Labs
All labs are finished.

## HW
HW1~5 are finished, HW6 and HW7 are too difficult for me.

## Project 0
It can run, but there is an issue in filename.   
In NBody.java, the filename need to be `"images/starfield.jpg"` instead of `"starfield.jpg"`, which lead to test failed.  

## Project 1A: 
In the standard implementation of ArrayDeque.java,
when the array is empty and the `addFirst()` operation is performed,
`nextLast` will move one place to the right,
instead of `nextFirst` moving one place to the left,
which is different from my implementation.

## Project 2:
JavaFX is hard to use, I didn't finish it.

## Project 3:
I have finished the most difficult part
